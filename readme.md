A Twitter bot that mirrors top image-based posts to `@awwtomatic` on twitter.com.

#### Installation

* `git clone https://github.com/salcido/awwbot.git` (this repository)
* change into the new directory
* `npm install`

You will need a Twitter account and you'll need to create a new App on Twitter from `https://apps.twitter.com/`.
Once the app has been created you'll need to create a `.env` file with the API keys provided by Twitter
when you created the app.

#### Running / Development

* Start the bot:
  * `npm start`
